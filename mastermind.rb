## Players to choose where codemaker or codebreaker

# Choose (1) codemaker or (2) comebreaker
# Choose number of games to play (best of 3?)
# Choose number of rows (8 - 12)

#### To make the game challenging, should we allow:
#### -  repeat colours for code maker or only unique colours?
#### -  response (review) from codemaker in order or out of order
####    selection? That is, position 1 review 1 colour 1
####
